## [Unreleased]

## [0.8.0] - 2026-10-03

### Added

- Search-first public site: an icon rail (Search, Alkitab, Kidung, Tata Ibadah, theme
  toggle) and a landing page whose search spans the whole corpus — Bible books,
  references, and verse text; songbooks, titles, and lyrics; Tata Ibadah titles and
  public contents — with grouped results, counts, excerpts, and exact reference
  resolution (`Matius 5:13`, `Kidung Jemaat 120` ≡ `KJ 120`).
- Public reading views for Bible chapters (verse numbers, TB/SIM translation toggle) and
  Tata Ibadah service orders (year+month groups, Templates view, section quicklinks).
- Dark mode by rail toggle, persisted and applied before first paint, with the palette
  AA-safe in light and dark.

### Changed

- Public pages rebuilt on the design language from spec 001: hand-written CSS with no
  framework, a narrow rail with nested sidebars (mini collapse for Bible, wide song list
  for Kidung), keyboard/touch ergonomics, and print that yields reading content only.
- Search behaviors: minimum three letters/numbers with an inline message; an invalid
  query never clears the last result set; the rail search icon restores the last result
  set, the logo starts a fresh search.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-10-01

### Added

- Maintenance mode (`MAINTENANCE_MODE`): the site root `/` serves a short notice
  (HTTP 503) while the reading home stays reachable at `/home/`.
- `[devops]` Local Docker Compose stack (`web` + `db`) on low-conflict ports
  from the IANA dynamic range, overridable via `WEB_PORT` / `DB_PORT` in `.env`.
  Container-internal ports stay conventional (`8000` / `5432`).

### Changed

- The public home moved from `/` to `/home/` while maintenance is on; `/` serves
  the home again when `MAINTENANCE_MODE` is off.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-09-30

### Added

- Public song-reading site at `/`: browse songbooks, read a song's lyrics, search by title or
  book number.
- A design language defined from scratch (`static/styles/design/`), with a palette drawn from
  the GKPS logo; public pages no longer depend on Fomantic UI.

### Changed

- The content editor moved from `/songs/…` to `/manage/…`; legacy paths redirect (301).
